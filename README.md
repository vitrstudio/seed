## Password Encryption

This application uses BCrypt for password encryption. All passwords are automatically encrypted before being stored in the database.

- **Password Verification**: Built-in methods to verify passwords during login

### Security Configuration
The application includes a `SecurityConfig` that disables default Spring Security authentication while keeping BCrypt available for password encoding.
